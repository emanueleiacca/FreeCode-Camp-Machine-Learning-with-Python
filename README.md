# Introduction to the "Machine Learning with Python" Course
offered by FreeCodeCamp, the course is designed to provide a strong foundation in machine learning concepts, while also offering practical experience through hands-on projects.

Key Topics Covered:
`Data Preprocessing:` Techniques for cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for analysis.

`Supervised Learning:` Algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, and support vector machines.

`Unsupervised Learning:` Clustering methods such as K-Means and dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA.

`Neural Networks:` Basics of deep learning and implementation of simple neural networks.

`Model Evaluation:` Metrics and methods for evaluating the performance of machine learning models.

# Course Projects:
The course includes several projects that reinforce the theoretical concepts by applying them to real datasets. 

## 1. SMS Text Classification

`Description:` This project involves building a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as spam or ham (not spam). The project utilizes text processing techniques such as tokenization, TF-IDF vectorization, and employs a machine learning algorithm to perform the classification. The model is trained and evaluated on a dataset of labeled SMS messages.

`Files:` fcc_sms_text_classification.ipynb

`Results:` The model achieves an accuracy of 100% on the test set, demonstrating effective classification between spam and ham messages.

## 2. Predicting Health Costs with Regression

`Description:` This project aims to predict the health insurance costs of individuals based on various factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, and more. The model uses regression techniques to model the relationship between these factors and the insurance cost.

`Files:` fcc_predict_health_costs_with_regression.ipynb

`Results:` The regression model provides reasonably accurate predictions of health insurance costs based on the input features, with MAE under 1500 as required by the task

## 3. Book Recommendation using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

`Description:` This project implements a book recommendation system using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. By analyzing the similarities between books based on user ratings, the system suggests books that a user might like. The project involves data preprocessing, training the KNN model, and evaluating its performance.

`Files:` fcc_book_recommendation_knn.ipynb

`Results:` The system provides personalized book recommendations with reasonable accuracy, we had to focus more on the data cleaning than on the model itself to meet the standards required by the test evaluation.

## 4. Cat vs. Dog Image Classification using CNN

`Description:` This project focuses on classifying images of cats and dogs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images and uses several layers of convolutions, pooling, and fully connected layers to learn the distinguishing features of the images.

`Files:` fcc_cat_dog.ipynb

`Results:` The model achieves an accuracy of 64% on the test set, effectively distinguishing between cats and dogs in the images.
